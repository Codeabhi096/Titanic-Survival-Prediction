### Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. The dataset used is the famous **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle, which contains various features such as **Pclass**, **Sex**, **Age**, **Fare**, **Embarked**, and more.

#### **Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using logistic regression and other machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers. This model can be used as a foundation for understanding machine learning concepts like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Logistic Regression** model for prediction.
- Data preprocessing techniques such as **handling missing values**, **feature encoding**, and **scaling**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Confusion matrix and classification report to analyze model's performance.

#### **Dependencies:**
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#### **How to Run:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to train the model and make predictions.

#### **Key Insights:**
- This model helps understand the relationships between different passenger features and their likelihood of survival.
- It's an excellent introductory project for anyone interested in learning machine learning, particularly for classification tasks.

#### **Future Improvements:**
- Experiment with other classification algorithms such as **Random Forest**, **SVM**, or **KNN**.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
- Deploying the model as a web app using **Flask** or **Django** for interactive predictions.

#### **Project Status:**
- Currently, the Titanic survival prediction model is trained and evaluated, and ready for further improvements or deployment.
